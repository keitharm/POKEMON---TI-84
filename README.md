# POKEMON-RED-TI-84
Pokemon Red for TI-84 - Text version up to the 3rd gym

I made this game back in high school, mainly during 2nd period Physics.

It is based off of Pokemon Red version and goes all the way up to the 3rd gym.
The reason why development stopped at the 3rd gym was because I ran out of RAM for adding more stuff :(

In order to play this game on your TI-83/84, copy the .8XG group file over to your calculator.
Then, unarchive it from the groups by going to MEM (2nd + "+"), Group... (8), UNGROUP, and selecting *POKEMON.
Selection Overwrite All (3), and then when it finishes extracting, launch the game by going to PRGM and choosing POKEMON

Enjoy!
